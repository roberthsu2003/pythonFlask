# The mean of a set of numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by the
# number of numbers. Write a procedure, list_mean, which takes a list of numbers
# as its input and return the mean of the numbers in the list.

# Hint: You will need to work out how to make your division into decimal
# division instead of integer division. You get decimal division if any of
# the numbers involved are decimals.

def list_mean(p):
    count = len(p)
    sum = 0
    for num in p:
        sum += num
    return sum / count

print(list_mean([1,2,3,4]))
#>>> 2.5
print(list_mean([1,3,4,5,2]))
#>>> 3.0
#print list_mean([])
#>>> ??? You decide. If you decide it should give an error, comment
# out the print line above to prevent your code from being graded as
# incorrect.
print(list_mean([2]))
#>>> 2.0
